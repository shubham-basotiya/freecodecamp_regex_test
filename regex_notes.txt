regex.test(/string/); // regex without quotes
test return true or false;
string.match(/regex/)
match store result in array;
test() or match() opposite each other.

+ -> look for characters that occur one or more times. 
* -> matches characters that occur zero or more times.
[] -> look for group of characters.
- -> range a-z OR 0-9.
^ -> exclude/not match
For example, /[^aeiou]/gi matches all characters that are not a vowel. Note that characters like ., !, [, @, / 
and white space are matched - the negated vowel character set only excludes the vowel characters.

In an earlier challenge, you used the caret character (^) inside a character set to create a negated character 
set in the form [^thingsThatWillNotBeMatched]. 
Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

i -> ignore case (uppercase/lowercase).
g -> global one or more then one
